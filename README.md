MemberLogin is a Umbraco backoffice extension package which allows you to impersonate as a Member into the front-end website.

## Getting Started

### Documentation

First you need to create a new datatype of type MemberLogin in your developer section of Umbraco.
After that, you add a new property into your member document type, using this new datatype.

As you will see, this is only a button for doing the login as a Member.

### History Version

#### v1.0.0

Initial release of the MemberLogin package.
